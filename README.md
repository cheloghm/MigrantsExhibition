    └── Constants.cs
```

#### **Key Constants and Their Descriptions:**

```csharp
public static class Constants
{
    // Cell/Image Settings
    public const float CellSizeLayer1 = 40f; // Size for the first layer
    public const float CellSizeLayer2 = CellSizeLayer1 * 0.9f; // 10% smaller than layer 1

    // Transparency Settings
    public const float CellOpacity = 1.0f; // Opacity for live cells (1.0f = fully opaque)
    public const float LayerOpacityDifference = 0.8f; // Layer 2 cells are 80% opaque compared to Layer 1

    // Movement and Frame Rate
    public const int TargetFPS = 48; // Target frame rate
    public const double GenerationIntervalLow = 1.0; // One generation per second at <=10% sound
    public const double GenerationIntervalHigh = 0.0; // No generation at >=70% sound
    public const double GenerationIntervalIncreasePer10Sound = 0.07; // 7% increase per 10% sound

    // Sound Intensity Thresholds (1-100 scale)
    public const float SoundThresholdLow = 10f; // 10%
    public const float SoundThresholdMedium = 20f; // 20%
    public const float SoundThresholdHigh = 70f; // 70%

}
```

#### **How to Modify Constants:**

1. **Open `Constants.cs`:**

   Navigate to the `Src` directory and open `Constants.cs` using your preferred code editor.

   ```
   MigrantsExhibition/
   └── Src/
       └── Constants.cs
   ```

2. **Locate the Desired Constant:**

   Scroll through the file to find the constant you wish to modify. Constants are grouped logically based on their functionality, such as cell settings, transparency, movement, sound thresholds, etc.

3. **Edit the Constant Value:**

   For example, to change the target frame rate from `48` to `60` FPS:

   ```csharp
   public const int TargetFPS = 60; // Target frame rate
   ```

4. **Save the File:**

   After making changes, save the `Constants.cs` file.

5. **Rebuild the Project:**

   To apply the changes, rebuild the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```

   *Alternatively, use your IDE's build functionality.*

#### **Common Modifications:**

- **Adjusting Cell Sizes:**
  - Increase or decrease `CellSizeLayer1` or `CellSizeLayer2` to change the size of cells in different layers.

- **Changing Opacity:**
  - Modify `CellOpacity` or `LayerOpacityDifference` to make cells more or less transparent.

- **Altering Movement Speed:**
  - Adjust `StarBaseSpeedMultiplier` or `StarSoundIntensityMultiplier` to influence the movement speed of stars based on depth and sound intensity.

- **Sound Thresholds:**
  - Change `SoundThresholdLow`, `SoundThresholdMedium`, or `SoundThresholdHigh` to redefine how sound intensity affects the simulation.

- **Vibration Intensity:**
  - Modify `VibrationIntensityHigh` to increase or decrease the vibration effect on stars and cells.

- **Fade-In Duration:**

2. **Start VcXsrv:**

   - Launch VcXsrv with default settings.
   - Ensure that **"Disable access control"** is checked to allow connections.

3. **Set DISPLAY Environment Variable:**

   Determine your host machine's IP address and set the `DISPLAY` variable accordingly. Open PowerShell and run:

   ```powershell
   $ip = (Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet").IPAddress
   ```

   Replace `"Ethernet"` with your active network interface if different.

4. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```powershell
   docker run -it `
       --env="DISPLAY=$ip:0.0" `
       --volume="//tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" `
       cheloghm/migrantsexhibition:1.9
   ```

   **Note:** Docker on Windows uses backticks (`) for line continuation in PowerShell.

## Additional Information

### Docker Considerations

Running GUI applications within Docker containers can be complex due to the need for GUI forwarding and audio handling. Below are some additional tips and considerations to ensure a smoother experience.

#### **1. Docker Daemon Must Be Running**

Ensure that Docker Desktop is installed and running on your system before attempting to build or run Docker containers.

- **Windows and macOS:**
  - Start Docker Desktop from the Start menu or Applications folder.
  
- **Linux:**
  - Start the Docker daemon using system commands (e.g., `sudo systemctl start docker`).

#### **2. Verifying Docker Installation**

To verify that Docker is installed and running correctly, execute:

```bash
docker version
```

You should see output indicating both the Client and Server (Docker daemon) versions.

#### **3. Troubleshooting Docker Errors**

If you encounter errors like:

```
ERROR: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

**Solutions:**

- **Restart Docker Desktop:**
  - Right-click the Docker icon in the system tray and select "Restart Docker."
  
- **Check Docker Service:**
  - Ensure that the Docker service is running. On Windows, check the Services panel (`services.msc`) for "Docker Desktop Service."

- **Reinstall Docker:**
  - If issues persist, consider reinstalling Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

#### **4. Granting Permissions for GUI Applications**

- **Linux:**
  - Run `xhost +local:docker` to allow Docker containers to access the X server.
  
- **macOS and Windows:**
  - Ensure that your X11 server (XQuartz for macOS, VcXsrv for Windows) is configured to accept connections.

#### **5. Audio Handling in Docker**

Handling audio input within Docker containers is advanced and may require additional configuration:

- **Linux:**
  - Use PulseAudio or ALSA to forward audio devices into the container.
  
- **macOS and Windows:**
  - Audio forwarding is more complex and may not be fully supported.

**Recommendation:**
For audio-reactive applications, running the application natively on the host OS is more reliable.

  - Make the application executable (if necessary):

    ```bash
    chmod +x MigrantsExhibition
    ```

  - Run the application:

    ```bash
    ./MigrantsExhibition
    ```

## Final Recommendations

- **Use Self-Contained Deployments:**
  - For a MonoGame application that requires GUI and audio input, self-contained deployments are the most practical solution.
  
- **Maintain the Dockerfile (Optional):**
  - If you still want to provide a Docker container for Linux users, keep the `Dockerfile` in your project. However, be aware of the complexities involved in GUI and audio handling within Docker.

- **Update `README.md`:**
  - Include clear instructions for building and running the application on each platform.
  - Provide guidance on how to use the Docker container if you choose to keep it.

- **Testing:**
  - Thoroughly test both local and Docker deployments on their respective operating systems to ensure a smooth user experience.
