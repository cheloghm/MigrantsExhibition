#### **Location:**

```
MigrantsExhibition/
└── Src/
    └── Constants.cs
```

#### **Key Constants and Their Descriptions:**

```csharp
public static class Constants
{
    // Cell/Image Settings
    public const float CellSizeLayer1 = 40f; // Size for the first layer
    public const float CellSizeLayer2 = CellSizeLayer1 * 0.9f; // 10% smaller than layer 1

    // Transparency Settings
    public const float CellOpacity = 1.0f; // Opacity for live cells (1.0f = fully opaque)
    public const float LayerOpacityDifference = 0.8f; // Layer 2 cells are 80% opaque compared to Layer 1

    // Movement and Frame Rate
    public const int TargetFPS = 48; // Target frame rate
    public const double GenerationIntervalLow = 1.0; // One generation per second at <=10% sound
    public const double GenerationIntervalHigh = 0.0; // No generation at >=70% sound
    public const double GenerationIntervalIncreasePer10Sound = 0.07; // 7% increase per 10% sound

    // Sound Intensity Thresholds (1-100 scale)
    public const float SoundThresholdLow = 10f; // 10%
    public const float SoundThresholdMedium = 20f; // 20%
    public const float SoundThresholdHigh = 70f; // 70%

    // Cell Population Control
    public const float MinLiveCellsPercentage = 15f; // Minimum 15% live cells

    // Vibration Parameters
    public const float VibrationIntensityHigh = 10f; // Max vibration at >=70% sound

    // Layers
    public const int TotalLayers = 3; // Three layers

    // Fade-In Parameters
    public const float FadeInDuration = 2.0f; // Fade-in duration in seconds

    // GUI Parameters
    public const int SoundMeterWidth = 200; // Width of the sound intensity meter
    public const int SoundMeterHeight = 20; // Height of the sound intensity meter

    // Star Parameters
    public const float StarBaseSpeedMultiplier = 15f; // Base speed multiplier for stars based on depth
    public const float StarSoundIntensityMultiplier = 7f; // Speed increase based on sound intensity
    public const float StarVibrationMultiplier = 3f; // Vibration strength for stars

    // Additional Parameters for Depth Illusion
    public const float ShadowOffset = 5f; // Pixels to offset Layer 1 shadows
    public const float GlowSizeMultiplier = 1.2f; // Multiplier for glow size
    public const float Layer1Elevation = 5f; // Pixels to offset Layer 1 cells upward
    public const float ShadowOpacity = 0.5f; // Opacity for shadows
    public const float GlowOpacity = 0.5f; // Opacity for glows

    // Layer Colors
    public static readonly Color Layer1Color = Color.Cyan;
    public static readonly Color Layer2Color = Color.MediumPurple;
    public static readonly Color Layer3Color = Color.LightGreen;
}
```

#### **How to Modify Constants:**

1. **Open `Constants.cs`:**

   Navigate to the `Src` directory and open `Constants.cs` using your preferred code editor.

   ```
   MigrantsExhibition/
   └── Src/
       └── Constants.cs
   ```

2. **Locate the Desired Constant:**

   Scroll through the file to find the constant you wish to modify. Constants are grouped logically based on their functionality, such as cell settings, transparency, movement, sound thresholds, etc.

3. **Edit the Constant Value:**

   For example, to change the target frame rate from `48` to `60` FPS:

   ```csharp
   public const int TargetFPS = 60; // Target frame rate
   ```

4. **Save the File:**

   After making changes, save the `Constants.cs` file.

5. **Rebuild the Project:**

   To apply the changes, rebuild the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```

   *Alternatively, use your IDE's build functionality.*

#### **Common Modifications:**

- **Adjusting Cell Sizes:**
  - Increase or decrease `CellSizeLayer1` or `CellSizeLayer2` to change the size of cells in different layers.

- **Changing Opacity:**
  - Modify `CellOpacity` or `LayerOpacityDifference` to make cells more or less transparent.

- **Altering Movement Speed:**
  - Adjust `StarBaseSpeedMultiplier` or `StarSoundIntensityMultiplier` to influence the movement speed of stars based on depth and sound intensity.

- **Sound Thresholds:**
  - Change `SoundThresholdLow`, `SoundThresholdMedium`, or `SoundThresholdHigh` to redefine how sound intensity affects the simulation.

- **Vibration Intensity:**
  - Modify `VibrationIntensityHigh` to increase or decrease the vibration effect on stars and cells.

- **Fade-In Duration:**
  - Alter `FadeInDuration` to make the initial fade-in effect faster or slower.
